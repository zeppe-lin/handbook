=head2 4.2. Boot a Live System

Since Zeppe-Lin is distributed in the form of a compiled tarball
containing a root filesystem, you will first need to boot your
computer using a Linux-based image, so called "Live CD/DVD/USB"
operating system.

Boot from the live CD/DVD/USB, open a terminal and get root privileges
(e.g. C<sudo su>).
