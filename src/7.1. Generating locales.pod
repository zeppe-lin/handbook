=head2 7.1. Generating locales

B<glibc> does not contain all possible locales, thus you'll have to
generate the locales you need/use.  To ensure the proper operation of
L<pkgmk(8)>, the locale C<C.UTF-8> is generated as part of the
B<glibc> package.  Any other desired locales must be created by the
administrator.

The following example is a typical setup for US users, replace
C<en_US*> with the locale you want:

    # localedef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8

To use this locale system-wide, add C<export LANG=en_US.UTF-8> to
F</etc/profile>.
