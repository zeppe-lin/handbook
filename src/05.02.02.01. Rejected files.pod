=head4 B<5.2.2.1. Rejected files>

If L<pkgadd(8)> finds that a specific file should not be upgraded, it
will install it under F</var/lib/pkg/rejected/>.  Files in this
directory are never added to the package database.  The user is then
free to examine, use and/or remove that file manually.  Another option
is to use L<rejmerge(8)>.  For each rejected file found in
F</var/lib/pkg/rejected/>, L<rejmerge(8)> will display the difference
between the installed version and the rejected version.  The user can
then choose to keep the installed version, upgrade to the rejected
version or perform a merge of the two.  Example (using the above
F</etc/pkgadd.conf>):

    # pkgadd -u bash#5.0.18-1.pkg.tar.gz
    pkgadd: rejecting etc/profile, keeping existing version

    # tree --charset=ascii /var/lib/pkg/rejected
    /var/lib/pkg/rejected
    `-- etc
        `-- profile
