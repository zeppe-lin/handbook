=head3 B<4.10.1. Install kernel package>

The C<pkgsrc-system> collection provides a package with the kernel and
non-free firmware:

    (chrooted) # pkgman install --deps --group \
        --config-append="runscripts no" linux linux-firmware

This B<linux> package has a B<post-install> script that executes
L<mkinitramfs(8)> and updates the B<grub> config.  We turn off the
execution of this script because we'll do it manually.  It is useful
when regularly updating the system but now it's unnecessary.

=item B<Note>:

You may like to lock the B<linux> package and not update it during
regular system updates, since the update will remove the current
working kernel and its modules.  If you plan not to turn off the
computer for a long time, it is better to do this and update the
kernel separately, through L<pkgman-update(8)>.  See L<pkgman-lock(8)>
for more information about package locking.

If you installed the kernel package through a package manager, you can
jump over the next paragraph, to the L</"Prepare initramfs image">.
