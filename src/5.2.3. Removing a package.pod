=head3 B<5.2.3. Removing a package>

Removing a package is done by using L<pkgrm(8)>.  This utility
requires one argument, the name of the package you want to remove.
Example:

    # pkgrm bash

=over

=item B<Warning>:

This will remove all files owned by the package, no questions
asked.  Think twice before doing it and make sure that you did
not misspell the package name since that could remove something
completely different (e.g. think about what could happen if you
misspelled glib as glibc).
