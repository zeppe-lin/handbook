=head2 4.7. Prepare The PKGSRC Repos

Packages' sources are organized in so-called collections, see
L</"The pkgsrc collections"> for more information about that.

Clone the collections you need, but keep in mind that each subsequent
collection depends on the previous ones.

    (chrooted) # cd /usr/src/
    (chrooted) # git clone https://github.com/zeppe-lin/pkgsrc-core
    (chrooted) # git clone https://github.com/zeppe-lin/pkgsrc-system
    (chrooted) # git clone https://github.com/zeppe-lin/pkgsrc-xorg
    (chrooted) # git clone https://github.com/zeppe-lin/pkgsrc-desktop

Edit F</etc/pkgman.conf> (see L<pkgman.conf(5)> for more information)
and enable the collections you cloned.  By default, only C<core>
collection is enabled.  Also, you may like to edit F</etc/pkgmk.conf>
(see L<pkgmk.conf(5)> for more information).
