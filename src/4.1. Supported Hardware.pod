=head2 4.1. Supported Hardware / Requirements

Packages on the official B<rootfs> image are compiled with
optimization for x86-64 (AMD Athlon 64, Intel Core, Intel Atom) or
newer processors.  Do not try to install it on an i686 (Pentium Pro,
Celeron, Pentium-III) or lower processor, it simply will not work.

Since Zeppe-Lin is distributed in the form of a compiled tarball
containing a root filesystem, the installation requires a live
CD/DVD/USB with any GNU/Linux.
