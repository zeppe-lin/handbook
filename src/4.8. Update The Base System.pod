=head2 4.8. Update The Base System

Before installing any package you need, it's highly recommended to
update the system which you just installed.

=item B<Warning>:

Starting from version C<6.0>, C<pkgutils> has broken backward
compatibility when generating footprint files.  So, at the beginning
it is recommended to update C<pkgmk> and C<pkgutils>:

    (chrooted) # pkgman update -f pkgmk pkgutils

=back

The following command tells to L<pkgman(1)> to run system update (with
dependency handling/sorting) and to stop if installation of at least
one package fails:

    (chrooted) # pkgman sysup --deps --depsort --group

It's also recommended to merge the files that were rejected during
updates:

    (chrooted) # rejmerge

=cut

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 sts=4 et cc=72 tw=70
