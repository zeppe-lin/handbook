=head2 4.2. Chroot Into Base System

Copy DNS configuration to have the availability to use the network
from the chrooted root:

    # cp /etc/resolv.conf etc/resolv.conf

Mount Linux's pseudo-filesystems:

    # mount -B /dev /mnt/dev
    # mount -B /tmp /mnt/tmp
    # mount -B /run /mnt/run
    # mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc
    # mount -t sysfs none /mnt/sys
    # mount -t devpts -o noexec,nosuid,gid=tty,mode=0620 devpts \
        /mnt/dev/pts

    (UEFI only)
    # mount -B /sys/firmware/efi/efivars /mnt/sys/firmware/efi/efivars

    # chroot /mnt /bin/bash

Set the B<SHELL> environment variable to I</bin/bash> in the chrooted
environment, to be available to call C<:shell> in vim, for example, or
other tools that relies on C<SHELL>.  This needs if the shell used
outside chroot is zsh, fish, or something else that is not present in
chroot environment:

    (chrooted) # export SHELL=/bin/bash

=cut

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 sts=4 et cc=72 tw=70
