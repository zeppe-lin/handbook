=head2 Adjusting/Configuring the Package Build Process

Many settings of the package build process can be adjusted by
editing the L<pkgmk(8)> configuration file F</etc/pkgmk.conf>.  Some
of these configurable settings include:

=begin man

.TS
center, box, tab (|) ;
l | l
l | l.
Setting|Description
_
.SP
CFLAGS|Define optimization and
CXXFLAGS|architecture options for package
|compilation.
|
|It's best NOT change these settings
|unless you absolutely know what
|you're doing!
_
PKGMK_SOURCE_MIRRORS|Define location(s) from which pkgmk
|will attempt to fetch source
|archives.
_
PKGMK_SOURCE_DIR|Define location where pkgmk will
|store (if downloading) and use
|source archives when building.
_
PKGMK_PACKAGE_DIR|Define location where pkgmk will
|create package files once the
|build process is complete.
_
PKGMK_WORK_DIR|Define a work area that pkgmk will
|use to build the package.

Here are some examples:

    PKGMK_SOURCE_MIRRORS="http://fileserver.intranet/dist/sources/"

This setting instructs pkgmk to attempt to fetch all source
archives from I<http://fileserver.intranet/dist/sources/> before
falling back to the source URL specified in the Pkgfile.  Multiple
URLs can be separated by spaces (the spaces in the URL itself replace
by C<%20>!).

    PKGMK_SOURCE_DIR="/var/cache/pkgmk/sources"

This setting instructs pkgmk to store and find source archives
in C</var/cache/pkgmk/sources>.  An example benefit of this setup
would be the ability to store C</var/cache/pkgmk/sources> on an NFS
server on your local network for use by multiple Zeppe-Lin
installations.  C<PKGMK_PACKAGE_DIR> can be set and used the same way.

    PKGMK_WORK_DIR="/var/cache/pkgmk/work/$name"

This setting instructs pkgmk to use
C</var/cache/pkgmk/work/$name> as a work area for building the
specified package.  Building the B<grep> package would result in the
work area being C</var/cache/pkgmk/work/grep>.  An alternative would
be to use a L<tmpfs(5)> as your work directory.

There are a few more settings that can be found on the
L<pkgmk.conf(5)> manual page.
