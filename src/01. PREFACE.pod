=head1 1. PREFACE

This handbook (and Zeppe-Lin itself) is inspired and based on the
L<CRUX Handbook|http://crux.nu/Main/Documentation>. It's not an
extensive guide on how to use and configure common Linux software.
The purpose of the handbook is to explain how to install, configure,
and maintain Zeppe-Lin systems, and to highlight the differences
between common Linux distributions and Zeppe-Lin.
