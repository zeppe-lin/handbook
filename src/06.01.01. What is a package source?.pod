=head3 B<6.1.1. What is a package source?>

A package source is a directory containing the files needed for
building a package using L<pkgmk(8)>.  This means that this directory
at least has the files F<Pkgfile> (which is the package build
description) and F<.footprint> (which is used for regression testing
and contains a list of files this package is expected to contain once
it is built).  Further, a package source directory can contain patches
and/or other files needed for building the package, even software
sources.  It is important to understand that the actual source code
for the package is not necessarily present in the package source
directory.  Instead, the F<Pkgfile> contains an URL that points to a
location where the source can be downloaded.

The use of the words "package source" in this context is borrowed
from the NetBSD world, where a package refers to a set of files and
building instructions that describe what's necessary to build a
certain piece of software.
