=head3 B<7.4.1. Passwords>

Zeppe-Lin uses C<SHA512> passwords by default.  To change the password
encryption method set the C<ENCRYPT_METHOD> variable in
F</etc/login.defs> to C<DES>, C<MD5>, or C<SHA256>.

Furthermore, when compiling programs that use the L<crypt(3)> function
to authenticate users you should make sure that these programs are
linked against the B<libcrypt> library (i.e. use C<-lcrypt> when
linking) which contains the C<SHA512> version of the crypt function
(this version is backward compatible and understands C<DES> passwords
as well).
