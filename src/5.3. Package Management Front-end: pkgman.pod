=head2 5.3. Package Management Front-end: pkgman

In its current form B<pkgutils> does not have a concept of dependency
handling.  To address this, a front-end utility called B<pkgman>
exists.  L<pkgman(1)> supports dependency handling (with the caveat
mentioned below) as well as some overlap with B<pkgutils> features.
