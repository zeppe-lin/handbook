=head3 B<5.3.2. Configuration>

pkgman's main configuration file, F</etc/pkgman.conf>, contains
options that can be used to change pkgman's behavior.  Notably in
this file, the following options can be configured:

=over 2

=item * C<pkgsrcdir>

This option can occur multiple times and specifies a directory with a
packages' sources "collection" which L<pkgman(1)> should check in its
operation.  By default, the I<core> collection is enabled, but
I<system>, I<xorg>, I<desktop>, and I<stuff> collections are
commented.

=item * C<runscripts>

This option configures L<pkgman(1)> to run C<pre-install>,
C<post-install>, C<pre-remove>, and C<post-remove> scripts if they
exist in the package source directory.  These scripts are run during
F<install>, F<update>, F<sysup>, and F<remove> operations.

It is recommended that this be enabled as in many cases if these
scripts exist in a package source directory, it is required to be
run for proper operation.

=item * C<logfile>

This option configures a file for pkgman to log its operation if
desired.

=back

This is B<NOT> an exhaustive list of all of pkgman's commands,
features, and configuration options, merely a starting point.  More
information can be found in L<pkgman(1)> and L<pkgman.conf(5)> manual
pages.
