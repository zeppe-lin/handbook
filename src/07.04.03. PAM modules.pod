=head3 B<7.4.3. PAM modules>

The core packages C<linux-pam> and C<dumb-runtime-dir> provide a
variety of modules that can be loaded upon logging in.  The files in
F</etc/pam.d> govern the association between the type of login (e.g.,
tty, SSH, su, X Display Manager) and the modules that get loaded
(e.g., pam_env, pam_exec, pam_limits).  Typical situations that can be
handled cleanly with PAM modules are listed in the table below.

=item B<Note>:

The existence of a writable C<XDG_RUNTIME_DIR> is required for proper
operation of many desktop applications.  A B<clean> Zeppe-Lin
installation (starting from C<v1.0>) will place a line in
F</etc/pam.d/common-session> that loads the module
F<pam_dumb_runtime_dir.so> to satisfy this requirement.
An B<upgrade> to Zeppe-Lin C<v1.0> might not do so, depending on your
C<UPGRADE> directives in F</etc/pkgadd.conf> or may require
L<rejmerge(8)> to update your F</etc/pam.d> configuration.

F<pam_dumb_runtime_dir.so> has a simple design and is limited to
creating the runtime directory and exporting C<XDG_RUNTIME_DIR>.
It's not managing all environment variables defined in the
freedesktop.org specification.

If you find yourself in one of the other situations in the table
above, read the man page for the corresponding PAM module to learn how
to accomplish the desired configuration.
