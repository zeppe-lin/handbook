=head3 B<7.4.2. User environment>

Configuration settings in F</etc/login.defs> like C<CREATE_HOME> and
C<USERGROUPS_ENAB> control the behaviour of L<useradd(8)> when
creating new users.

Creating a new user via C<useradd -m> will not populate the home
directory with a basic shell startup file, like other distributions
whose F</etc/skel> contains the idea of an initial home directory.

The C<PATH> value for shells that use F</etc/profile> is consistent
regardless of C<UID> and is set to C</sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin>.
This configuration allows unprivileged users easy access to
administrative commands without needing to type the full path,
provided they use L<bash(1)> or L<dash(1)>/L<sh(1p)> and have
appropriate L<sudo(8)> permissions.

=item B<Note>:

Zeppe-Lin users can create F</etc/skel> skeletons, choose different
shells and manage C<PATH> themselves.  The default setup aims to
reduce confusion.
