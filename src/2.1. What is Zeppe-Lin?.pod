=head2 2.1. What is Zeppe-Lin?

Zeppe-Lin is a lightweight GNU/Linux distribution for the x86-64
architecture targeted at experienced users.  It is forked from CRUX
and the primary focus of this distribution is "keep it simple" too.

The KISS principle reflects in a simple I<tar.gz>-based package
system, BSD-style init scripts, and a relatively small collection of
trimmed packages.

The secondary focus is the utilization of new GNU/Linux features and
recent tools and libraries.
