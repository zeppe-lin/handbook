TODO handbook
=============


No milestone
------------
  - [ ] add DEVELOPMENT section?
        https://github.com/zeppe-lin/handbook/issues/7

  - [ ] add EPUB version of the handbook?
        https://github.com/zeppe-lin/handbook/issues/6

  - [ ] move some instructions from INSTALL section to CONFIGURATION:
        https://github.com/zeppe-lin/handbook/issues/5

  - [ ] fix text variant of the handbook:
        https://github.com/zeppe-lin/handbook/issues/4

  - [ ] mention the cron jobs that are enabled by default:
        https://github.com/zeppe-lin/handbook/issues/3

  - [ ] add "Update Zeppe-Lin" section:
        https://github.com/zeppe-lin/handbook/issues/2

  - [ ] reword "{Download,Extract} rootfs tarball" sections:
        https://github.com/zeppe-lin/handbook/issues/1

        The following sections of the documentation contain a hardcoded
        version of rootfs:

        https://zeppe-lin.github.io/handbook.7.html#Download-rootfs-tarball
        https://zeppe-lin.github.io/handbook.7.html#Extract-rootfs-tarball

        It would be better to make the text more generalized with a link
        to the page with the latest release.  Then there is no need to
        change the version in the handbook with each new release of
        rootfs.
